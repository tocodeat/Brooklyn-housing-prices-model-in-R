# Brooklyn-housing-prices-model-in-R

The purpose of this project is to determine how Brooklyn home purchase prices changed between Q3 2020 and Q4 2020 using linear regression. 

The data on real estate purchases within the borough of Brooklyn from 2016-2020, provided by the City of New York is used.  For the purposes of this analysis, we will only consider purchases of single-family residences and single-unit apartments or condos.

The linear regression model predicts prices based on various predictors such as gross area, neighborhood, building type, year of sale, and quarter of sale. The results show that mean prices increased significantly from Q3 to Q4 2022, and the mean prices for the year 2020 were the highest in comparison to the years before. The model's predictions are supported by the post-COVID shift in society dynamics, which has led to increased demand and rising prices in low- and middle-income areas like Brooklyn.
